<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

<!-- ================= Teaching Statement ================= -->
<h2>Teaching Statement</h2>
<p>
My teaching philosophy is grounded in clarity, inclusiveness, and motivation.  
I aim to create classroom environments where every student—regardless of background—feels supported, challenged, and confident in their ability to learn and apply engineering concepts.  
My goal is to develop courses where students actively engage with real-world problems and experience the joy of discovery as they build solutions step by step.
</p>

<!-- ================= Teaching Philosophy ================= -->
<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p>
My approach to teaching follows a simple and effective structure:  
<strong>motivation → problem framing → guided discovery → practice and synthesis → sharing results.</strong>  
This sequence helps students understand why a topic matters, how to express engineering problems clearly, and how to build solutions systematically.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of each course, I connect new material to practical engineering applications.  
By using intuitive explanations, demonstrations, and hands-on modules, I help students explore concepts before introducing formal definitions.  
Collaborative discussions and worksheet-based reasoning encourage deeper learning and build confidence.
</p>

<p>
I design small applied projects that allow students to see themselves as engineers—something they can build, test, and improve.  
I gather frequent feedback, maintain a respectful environment, and help students connect course concepts to their long-term goals.  
My commitment is to create an inclusive, motivating space where students develop curiosity, confidence, and the skills required to succeed in engineering.
</p>

<!-- ================= Teaching Experience ================= -->
<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

<p>
As an <strong>independent instructor</strong> at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE),  
K. N. Toosi University of Technology, and Azad University (Hashtgerd Branch),  
I have redesigned and taught multiple undergraduate engineering courses.  
My responsibilities include developing syllabi, designing laboratory modules, preparing assignments and exams, supervising design projects, and mentoring students in theoretical and experimental components.
</p>

<h3>Courses I Have Taught & Developed</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sensors & Actuators:</strong> Developed lab-centered instruction using LiDAR, IMU, and encoder systems to connect sensor modeling with real control applications.</li>

  <li><strong>Integrated Mechatronics with Raspberry Pi:</strong> Sole instructor for MATLAB-based numerical analysis; designed lectures, projects, and exams covering curve fitting, numerical integration, and ODE solving.</li>

  <li><strong>Dynamic Systems Laboratory:</strong> Designed hands-on modules using Arduino, LabVIEW, and real-time data acquisition; supervised team-based algorithm projects.</li>

  <li><strong>Ground Vehicle Dynamics:</strong> Taught fundamentals of vehicle modeling, simulation, and automotive-oriented dynamics.</li>

  <li><strong>Automatic Control:</strong> Taught foundational control theory and implemented hands-on process control and robotics projects.</li>

  <li><strong>Industrial Design & Drawing:</strong> Taught technical drafting and mechanical detailing using AutoCAD and SolidWorks.</li>

  <li><strong>Machine Design by Computers:</strong> Guided students from analytical design to drafting and documentation of mechanical systems.</li>

  <li><strong>Finite Element Analysis with ANSYS:</strong> Delivered a project-based course covering structural, dynamic, and coupled solid–fluid analysis.</li>

  <li><strong>Engineering Programming (C++ & MATLAB):</strong> Taught algorithms, programming, and tool selection for prototyping, real-time control, and software development.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I was honored with the <strong>Outstanding Instructor Award (2014 & 2016)</strong>  
based on student evaluations at Azad University (Hashtgerd Branch),  
recognizing my commitment to hands-on, student-centered engineering education.
</p>

<!-- ================= Courses I Can Teach ================= -->
<h2>Courses I Can Teach & Develop</h2>

<p>
I am prepared to teach a wide range of undergraduate and introductory graduate courses in  
<strong>Dynamics, Vibrations, Control Systems, Mechatronics, Sensors & Actuators, Embedded Systems, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems.</strong>
</p>

<p>
I can also develop advanced robotics and autonomy courses that address modern industry and research needs, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SLAM & Behavioral Planning for Autonomous Systems:</strong>  
  A project-driven course combining multi-sensor SLAM with human-centered planning and intention prediction;  
  highly relevant to modern autonomous-vehicle research and industry.</li>

  <li><strong>Industrial Automation with PLCs and Industrial Robots (FANUC/ABB):</strong>  
  A practical course on PLC programming, industrial robotics, robot path planning,  
  and automation integration—skills highly demanded by aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing industries.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These courses complement modern mechanical and mechatronics programs  
and prepare students for expanding career paths in robotics, autonomous systems,  
industrial automation, and intelligent manufacturing.
